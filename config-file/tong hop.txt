Delete Firefox and all it's data:
Thanks are also due to snap question and its answers and comments

I think this can be done in six easy steps, please edit my answer - or tell me to - if it's not complete:

Run type firefox. You will either get

firefox is /usr/bin/firefox or
firefox is /snap/bin/firefox
If you get

Output	Firefox has been installed by
firefox is /usr/bin/firefox	apt
firefox is /snap/bin/firefox	snap
Apt and snap are ways to install packages. (package managers) If the answer is apt, follow these steps . Steps for snap are after it.

Steps to follow if apt

Run sudo apt-get purge firefox Unless you are serious about data privacy this step should be enough

Delete .mozilla/firefox/ in your home directory, should it still be there

Delete .macromedia/ and .adobe in your home directory, these can contain "Flash Cookies" stored by the browser. The same is true, if applicable, for Silverlight (Moonlight) and other plugins, they can allow websites to store data on your computer.

Delete /etc/firefox/, this is where your preferences and user-profiles are stored

Delete /usr/lib/firefox/ should it still be there

Delete /usr/lib/firefox-addons/ should it still be there

Mind the periods in front of file- and directory names: They indicate a hidden directory. You can tell your File Browser to show them by pressing Ctrl+H.

The 4th and 5th step must be done with superuser privileges. To start a the File Browser as a superuser, press Alt+F2 and enter gksu nautilus.

Finally, restart your computer to get rid of all temporary files. This should remove all traces of firefox ever being there.

Important:

Don't rely on this method if you've got sensitive information to protect! Deleting a file, in most cases, only means deleting a reference to it. The raw data will still be on your hard drive, and the proverbial bond-villain will be able to recover them. I'm only mentioning this in case it's applicable to anybody who reads this. The only way to really get rid of data is to shred the hard drive to bits.
Steps to follow if snap
